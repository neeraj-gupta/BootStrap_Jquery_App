                        Big data is being generated by everything around us at all times.
                        Every digital process and social media exchange produces it.
                        Systems, sensors and mobile devices transmit it.
                        Big data is arriving from multiple sources at an alarming velocity, volume and variety.
                        To extract meaningful value from big data, you need optimal processing power, analytics capabilities and skills.
